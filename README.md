# Brain-tumor-identification-using-MRI-image-processing
This project accurately identifies brain tumor of a patient with classification of level 
First we have to download Dataset of MRI images of brain from Kaggle website.
Steps to run:
First we have to run main code which will Train the Dataset of MRI images.
second we have to run testing code ,in which file explorer will be opened from which we can select the MRI images for testing which will give output whether patient is effected by Brain tumor or not ,if patiesnt is effected it will classify with level of tumor.
